## 4. Dataset Creation Steps

### 1.how were fg created with transparency
#### A: fg transparency was created using Gimp. Magic wand tool was used to select the fg and rest were deleted
### 2.how were masks created for fgs
#### A: Masks were created using OpenCV library. For the FGs where the pixel value was transparent, it was marked black and wherever pixel value was >=1 it was assigned white in the mask image. <br>Code: https://github.com/deepakgowtham/EVA4/blob/master/Week14/Session15A_Mask_RCNN_CV2.ipynb
### 3.how did you overlay the fg over bg and created 20 variants
#### A: For fg_bg : used openCV again to overlay the fg over bg. For every combination of fg and bg, position of the fg was randomly generated 20 times. for every random position generation, 2 fg_bg images were created, one with the fg and other with the fg LR flipped.<br> Image overlay was done using calculation of alpha value of the foreground to maintain transparency of fg over bg.<br> Code: https://github.com/deepakgowtham/EVA4/blob/master/Week14/Session15A_Mask_RCNN_CV2.ipynb
### 4.how did you create your depth images? 
#### A: Depth images were created using the DenseDepth model using kitti weights. <br>Source : https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth.git <br> the images were stored as one channel only.<br> Code: https://github.com/deepakgowtham/EVA4/blob/master/Week14/Session15A_Mask_RCNN_Depth.ipynb
